# GHSL-data-retrieval-app
Here's a possible deployment plan for this app:

1. Choose a cloud platform to host the application. Some popular options are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. For this example, we'll use AWS.
2. Create an EC2 instance on AWS to host the application. Choose an instance type that is suitable for the anticipated load of the application. A t2.micro instance should suffice for testing and development purposes.
3. Install the necessary dependencies on the EC2 instance, including Python and the required Python packages. You can use a package manager like pip to install the dependencies.
4. Copy the app.py, index.html, and app.js files to the EC2 instance. You can use scp to securely transfer the files to the instance.
5. Configure the security group associated with the EC2 instance to allow incoming traffic on port 80, which is used for HTTP traffic.
6. Start the Flask server on the EC2 instance using the command python app.py. This will start the Flask server and listen for incoming requests.
7. Verify that the application is running by navigating to the public IP address of the EC2 instance in a web browser. You should see the homepage of the application.
8. Optionally, you can use a domain name registrar to register a custom domain name for the application and configure DNS settings to point the domain name to the public IP address of the EC2 instance.

Note that this deployment plan is a simplified example and may need to be adjusted depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the application. Additionally, for production use, you may want to consider using a WSGI server like uWSGI or Gunicorn to improve the performance and reliability of the application.
